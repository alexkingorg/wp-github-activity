Pulls your activity feed from GitHub (with local caching) and allows you to display it via shortcode or widget.

You can even specify types of updates to exclude from the list (for example, you might decide 'watching' a reposity isn't noteworthy).

**Shortcode Syntax**

[github_activity username="alexkingorg" count="5" excluded="create, watch"]

The excluded parameter is optional, and uses the keywords included in the HTML comment that appears just before each GitHub activity item.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I list activity for more than one user? =

Sure, just add another widget or shortcode with the desired username.

= How do I disable the default styling? =

There is a filter `cf_github_activity_css_output` to allow you to turn off the CSS output. Attach to this filter and return `true`.
